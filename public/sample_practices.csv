Practice saying 'Good job!' and giving high-fives.",5,35,"Split into 4 groups. Spend 8-9 minutes at each station. Focus on fun and participation over perfection.",Alligator Chomps,"Players sit with legs apart, glove on ground between legs. Coach rolls ball slowly toward glove. Player 'chomps' the ball like an alligator eating. Emphasize keeping eye on ball and using both hands.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example1,Statue Throwing,"Players stand like statues, then 'come alive' to throw. Start 5 feet apart. Focus on stepping toward target and following through. Celebrate every throw that reaches partner.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example2,Tee Ball Swings,"Each player gets 5 swings off tee.

Cheer for every contact, no matter where ball goes.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example3,Base Running Parade,"Players line up and run bases one at a time like a parade.

Teaches tracking and hand-eye coordination. Switch roles so everyone gets to toss too.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example6,Step and Throw,"Focus on stepping toward target with opposite foot.

Celebrate good steps even if throw is off target.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example7,Tee Work Plus,"Hit off tee, but now try to hit ball to different areas. 'Hit it to the moon!'

Makes hitting directional and fun.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example8,Red Light Green Light Bases,"Players run bases but must freeze on 'red light'. Teaches base running control and listening to coaches. Add 'yellow light' for jogging to increase complexity.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example9,Beat the Coach,"Players try to run around all bases before coach can field a hit ball and touch home plate.

Give specific praise for improvement since last week.",5,Wall Ball,"Throw a tennis ball against a wall and catch it. Start close to wall, step back as you improve.
