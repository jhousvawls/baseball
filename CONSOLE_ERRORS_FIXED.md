# Console Errors Fixed - Baseball Practice Application

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. ✅ **Firebase Permissions Error** (CRITICAL - FIXED)
**Error**: `Missing or insufficient permissions` when logging login attempts
**Root Cause**: Firestore security rules missing `login_attempts` collection permissions
**Solution**: Updated `firestore-security-rules-clean.txt` to include:
```javascript
// Allow authenticated users to read/write login attempts for security monitoring
match /login_attempts/{document} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

### 2. ✅ **Missing Favicon** (FIXED)
**Error**: `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (File not found)` for favicon.ico
**Solution**: Created `app/public/favicon.ico` file to eliminate 404 error

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling** (IMPROVED)
**Issue**: Firebase connection errors causing application disruption
**Solution**: Improved error handling in `logLoginAttempt()` function:
- Changed from `console.error` to `console.warn` for non-critical login logging
- Added graceful fallback that doesn't break app functionality
- Login attempt logging now fails silently if permissions aren't set up yet

### 4. ⚠️ **Tailwind CSS Production Warning** (INFORMATIONAL)
**Warning**: `cdn.tailwindcss.com should not be used in production`
**Status**: This is acceptable for your vanilla JS practice app
**Note**: The warning is informational. For a vanilla JS app like yours, the CDN approach is fine. The warning applies more to build-process applications.

## ✅ **Firebase Security Rules Updated** (COMPLETED)

**STATUS**: Firebase security rules have been successfully updated in the Firebase Console.

### Applied Rules:
The following security rules are now active in your Firestore database:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Allow read access to practices for all users (anonymous and authenticated)
    match /practices/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write authorized coaches
    // Only super admin can write to this collection
    match /authorized_coaches/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.token.email == 'john.housholder@gmail.com';
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write practice changes for activity tracking
    match /practice_changes/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write login attempts for security monitoring
    match /login_attempts/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```
