FIRESTORE SECURITY RULES FOR MULTI-COACH SYSTEM
===============================================

To enable the multi-coach admin system, you need to update your Firestore security rules in the Firebase Console.

1. Go to Firebase Console (https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project: "baseball-practice-generator"
3. Go to Firestore Database > Rules
4. Replace the existing rules with the following:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    
    // Allow read access to practices for all users (anonymous and authenticated)
    match /practices/{document} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write authorized coaches
    // Only super admin can write to this collection
    match /authorized_coaches/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
        request.auth.token.email == 'admin@braves-practice.com';
    }
    
    // Allow authenticated users to read/write practice changes for activity tracking
    match /practice_changes/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click "Publish" to save the rules

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Change 'admin@braves-practice.com' to your actual super admin email address
- These rules allow:
  * Anyone to read practice plans (for public viewing)
  * Authenticated users to edit practices
  * Only the super admin to manage coaches
  * Authenticated users to log and view activity changes

AUTHENTICATION SETUP:
1. In Firebase Console, go to Authentication > Sign-in method
2. Enable "Google" sign-in provider
3. Enable "Email/Password" sign-in provider (for fallback)
4. Add your domain to authorized domains if needed

The multi-coach system is now ready to use!
